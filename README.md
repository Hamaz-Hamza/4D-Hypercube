# 4D-Hypercube

A Processing sketch made using the processing IDE. 
Displaying a rotating 4 Dimensional HyperCube/Tesseract by using 15 4x1 Matrices/4-length vectors to store the positions of each vertex of the tesseract and rotating the tesseract by multiplying each point by an appropriate rotation matrix.

Since 4D shapes cannot actually be displayed fully in 3D, this sketch displays only the 3D projection on the screen.

Made using processing's 3D mode.

Inspiration taken from "The Coding Train" from YouTube

To run the sketch you would need to import the files into Processing Foundation's Processing IDE.
